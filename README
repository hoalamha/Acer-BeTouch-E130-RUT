Acer BeTouch E130 ROM Update Tool (for Linux/OS X)
Copyright (c) 2011 Yohanes Nugroho

This tool can be used for:
- unpacking nb0 file
- repacking nb0 file
- writing a single package from nb0 file to phone
- writing entire nb0 file to phone (NOT TESTED)

The protocol for the ROM update is proprietary, and I reverse engineered
it by sniffing the USB communication of Rom Update Tool (RUT) for Windows. 

It may work for other Android phone that uses Windows RUT, but since I
can not test it, I am labeling this tool only for use in Acer BeTouch
E130.
